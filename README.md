# Open Heart Protocol

The Open Heart protocol lets an anonymous user sends an emoji reaction to a URL.

<div class="reactions">
<open-heart href="https://api.openheart.fyi" emoji="‚ù§Ô∏è"></open-heart>
<open-heart href="https://api.openheart.fyi" emoji="ü´Ä"></open-heart>
<open-heart href="https://api.openheart.fyi" emoji="ü•®"></open-heart>
</div>

## How

Set up an endpoint to receive an Open Heart `POST` request like this one:

```bash
curl -d 'ü•®' -X POST 'https://api.openheart.fyi'
```

A Open Heart message should contain of a single emoji sequence. However, the emoji sequence may be followed by arbitrary data which the server is expected to ignore. 

This allows HTML `<form>`s to post reactions using the Open Heart protocol through an empty input. In this case, the payload will be `ü•®=`.

```html
<form action="https://api.openheart.fyi" method="POST" enctype="text/plain">
  <button name="ü•®">ü•®</button>
</form>
```

## UI

It's a good idea to give visitors an easy way to send such requests; for example, with:

- [`<open-heart>`](https://github.com/mochokidae/open-heart-element)

## Count

Optionally, a `GET` request to the same URL may respond with the emoji reaction counts.

```bash
curl 'https://api.openheart.fyi'
```

The response should be a JSON object mapping Emoji (as Strings) to their count (as Numbers):

```json
{"‚ù§Ô∏è": 14,"ü´Ä": 12,"ü•®": 22}
```

If reaction counts are read-only, the server should respond with a [403](https://http.cat/403).

## Questions

### Why not [`WebMention`](https://webmention.rocks/)?

This is simpler.

### What happens after POST?

The author of the endpoint decides.

### What if the someone repeatedly sends emoji to my server?

It shows they may be quite enthusiastic.

### What if I don't want to receive some emoji?

Create a server-side allow list or disallow list and respond with a [400](https://http.cat/400).
